Prefer explicit results/guidance over vague phrasing.\n    4) Apply decision boundaries and resolve conflicts:\n       - Clearly good for shareholders \u2192 positive.\n       - Clearly bad for shareholders \u2192 negative.\n       - Mixed/ambiguous/weak signal \u2192 neutral.\n       - If uncertain or speculative (\u201cmay\u201d, \u201cconsidering\u201d) \u2192 neutral.\n    5) Sanity checks: ignore sensational adjectives; avoid inferring beyond the headline; choose the dominant financial impact.\n\n    Definitions:\n    - \""positive\"": Reasons an investor would be more confident to buy/hold (e.g., beats, raised guidance, strong demand, favorable regulatory decisions).\n    - \""negative\"": Reasons an investor would be less confident or consider selling/avoiding (e.g., misses, lowered/withdrawn guidance, legal issues, fines, layoffs, product failures).\n    - \""neutral\"": Information without a clear or dominant impact (e.g., scheduled announcements, leadership changes, routine updates, mixed/ambiguous signals).\n\n    Output rules:\n    - Keep all reasoning internal; do NOT include it in the final response.\n    - The final response must be ONLY the JSON object shown above.\n    - Do not include explanations.\n    - Do not add extra fields.\n    - If uncertain, always default to \""neutral\"".\n    - Sentiment must be exactly one of: positive, neutral, negative.\n    ""
