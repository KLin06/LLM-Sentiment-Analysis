Notes
- current version of ollama is llama3.2:3b
- temperature = 0 because I want consistent and deterministic answers (easier to test)

Prompt Must Include:
Instruction - a specific task or instruction you want the model to perform
Context - external information or additional context that can steer the model to better responses
Input Data - the input or question that we are interested to find a response for
Output Indicator - the type or format of the output.

C: Context: Provide background and information on the task
O: Objective: Define the task that you want the LLM to perform
S: Style: Specify the writing style you want the LLM to use
T: Tone: Set the attitude and tone of the response
A: Audience: Identify who the response is for

TO-DO
Figure out a way to improve the Prompt
Calculate accuracy
Figure out a way to constrain the model to using json (use outlines)
Define what the each of the sentiments means
Utilize keywords
Look into the Ollama options
Figure out different ways to analyze the error
    - look at the majority class (compare the ratios of positive, neutral, negative in prediction vs truth)
    - see whether I confuse neutral - positive, neutral - negative, or positive - negative
    - look at the things that impact it
Voting of different prompts
Look at parallel methods (purpose like if the llm is trying to grab attention) -> maybe feed this in as an input
Batching Headlines
Analyze the spread of the input data (percentage of each type)
